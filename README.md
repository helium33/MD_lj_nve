*What for: This is a sample MD simulation program, which simulates atomic liquid in NVE ensemble.  
*Who: Shanshan Wu  
*When: 12/03/2018 

*Contents:

*Main functions:
1. init_struc.c: Generate initial trajectory with fcc lattice.
2. md.c: Do md simulation in NVE ensemble with the fcc initial structure as input and random velocity following normal distribution
3. traj_analy.c: Do trajectory analysis
	1. plot kinetic energy, potential energy and total energy as function of time
	2. calculate radial distribution function as a function of r
	3. calculate translational order parameter as a function of time
*Tool functions:
tool.c: Matrix calculation, vector calculation, file input and output, etc

*run program:
1. All the simulation parameters are included in the md.par file, which is located in the data_files folder.
2. All the data files generated by the program will be saved in the data_files folder as well.
3. To compile the program, just simply type "make" and all the executable programs will be generated.
4. To run the program, type the name of executable program and the name of parameter file with complete or relative directory in the command line. For example, to generate initial structure, type: "./initStruct ./data_files/md.par" in command line. To do md, type: "./md ./data_files/md.par"
